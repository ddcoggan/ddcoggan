Hi, I’m David Coggan, currently a post-doctoral researcher in cognitive and computational neuroscience. I work under Frank Tong at Vanderbilt University, TN.

I will be looking for jobs in deep learning / data science starting in 2023.

I can program in Python and MATLAB, and have been using PyTorch to develop and train deep convolutional neural networks.

You can reach me at ddcoggan [at] gmail.com
