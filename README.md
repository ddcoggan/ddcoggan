I’m David Coggan, currently a post-doctoral researcher in cognitive and computational neuroscience. I work under Frank Tong at Vanderbilt University, where I study the neural and computational underpinnings of visual object perception.

I will be looking for jobs in computer vision / deep learning / data science / vision science starting in April 2023.

Please see the attached resume for more information.
